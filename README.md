# BloodSugar

This is a program that a Type 1 Diabetic enters their blood sugar and it tells them what it means. It then stores the numbers in a different location until they are done testing. When they rerun the program the list of numbers restarts. It goes above the requirements of a normal tester becuase it not only tells them what to do but it also tells them how far their blood sugar is from the average number/the number they are supossed to be.
